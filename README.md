# ShizenTerrainTools
THIS TOOL IS INCOMPLETE
As of 28/03/19, only a basic form of the Height Generation tool is currently implemented. This is mainly due to my experimentation with UI styles and skins.
To use this repository, simply clone, open it in Unity 2018.3.0f1 or higher and open the SampleScene. To then view to tool, select the terrain and click the Open Shizen Terrain Tools button. 

Shizen Terrain Tools is a Unity plugin that generates Terrain, from the major geographical details, to the minute, such as grass placement. 

There are four sections to Shizen: Height Tools, Texture Tools, Object Tools and Detail Tools. 

Height Tools control the actual 'heights' of the terrain, from mountains to valleys. 

Texture Tools control the automatic and contextual placement of textures on the terrain, placing grass textures on a plain and rock textures on a mountain. 

Object Tools are responsible for autonomously placing objects around a terrain, quickly populating forests and rocky outcrops with 3D objects. 

Detail Tools are responsible for the smaller details of the environment, things like physical grass and flowers.
